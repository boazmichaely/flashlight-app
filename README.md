# Walklight - Safety Flashlight

**The smart safety light for outdoor walking and running.**

While holding your phone naturally, your hand movements leverage both the LED flashlight and screen to make sure you are visible to others. Perfect for evening walks, early morning runs, or any time you need safe, adaptable lighting that won't blind you or drain your battery.

**What makes Walklight special?** Unlike most flashlight apps, Walklight gives you intelligent dual control for both your phone's LED flashlight and screen brightness. Plus it's 100% free, open source, with no ads.

## Status

ðŸš€ **Production Release v1.18.15** - Ready for Play Store (Companion App Settings + Bug Fixes)

### Version History
- **v1.4.0** - **NEW ICON:** Person walking with dual safety lighting - clearly shows LED + screen functionality, perfect Walklight brand alignment
- **v1.3.2** - Polished unified light blue toggle design, perfect size consistency, superior UX discovery flow
- **v1.2** - Three-state adaptive layout (sync/independent/screen-only modes), intelligent UI that hides inactive controls, compact horizontal layout
- **v1.1** - Dual-slider system (LED + screen brightness), smooth operation, visual syncing, "Pay It Forward" icon  
- **v1.0** - Basic flashlight with intensity control and device compatibility

## How the Smart Layout System Works

Our app features an intelligent three-state layout system that adapts based on user context, showing only the controls you actually need:

    C -->|flashlight OFF| B
    C -->|sync ON| A
    
    style A fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    style B fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff  
    style C fill:#FF9800,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
```

**Why this matters:** Instead of cluttering the screen with disabled controls (like most apps), ours intelligently shows only what's functional. When the flashlight is off, why show a grayed-out LED slider? Our interface adapts to give you maximum precision where it counts.

## Development Procedures

### Version Bump Process

**Versioning Scheme: M.n.C**
- **M** = Major version (big architectural/UI changes, requires approval)  
- **n** = Minor version (new features, significant improvements)
- **C** = Code version (Play Store upload version, change only when publishing)

**Steps for Version Bump:**
```bash
# 1. Update version in app/build.gradle (e.g. 1.14.14 â†’ 1.15.14)
# 2. Update README.md latest release version
# 3. Update NEXT_STEPS.md version references

# 4. Commit version changes
git add app/build.gradle README.md NEXT_STEPS.md
git commit -m "ðŸŽ¯ Version bump to 1.15.14 - [Description of changes]"

# 5. Create checkpoint tag
git tag v1.15.14
# OR for major milestones:
git tag checkpoint/[milestone-name]

# 6. Update recovery commands in NEXT_STEPS.md if needed
```

**Version Bump Rules:**
- **Minor features/improvements**: Increment `n` only (e.g., 1.14.14 â†’ 1.15.14)
- **Major changes**: Increment `M`, reset `n` (requires approval)  
- **Play Store upload**: Increment `C` and `versionCode` (only when publishing)

## Development Credits
